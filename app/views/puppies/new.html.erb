<!--
  TODO: Create your form here!

  Your form should:
  - Use Rails form helpers (form_with)
  - Submit to the puppies_path (POST /puppies)
  - Have fields for: name, breed, age
  - Have a submit button with "submit" text and type="submit"

  Hint: Use form_with helper with a model parameter instead of url parameter
  This will automatically set the correct action and method
